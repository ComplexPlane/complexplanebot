# ComplexPlaneBot

This is a bot written in Python 3 for [my Twitch stream](https://twitch.tv/complexplane)!
It supports looking up stuff on speedrun.com, some normal stream commands, some less-normal
stream commands, and hopefully some more cool stuff in the future.

You  get a free cookie from me if you can crash it. Feature suggestions are welcome too!

If you'd like to add some of these commands to your own Twitch chat, let me know! The bot will
reside in your chat and only respond to the commands marked *shared*.
